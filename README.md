# ⚡️ sonobe ⚡️
Zig game engine

## name
Inspired by modular origami, this engine borrows its name from the sonobe unit.
Each unit, while itself simple can be combined to create a more complex and greater whole.
Similarly I want sonobe engine to be comprised of useful units that can be assembled and allow full flexibility for the user.
